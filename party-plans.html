	<p>La Macarena is Barcelona's underground gem – a diminutive, subterranean, rough-around-the-edges sweatbox of a club. When things get overexcited here, you might end up standing on the DJ's toes – the main booth is in the middle of a very small dancefloor. Centrally located in the Gothic Quarter, it's easy to find and easier to stumble home from, especially if you're staying downtown. Macarena features well known DJ's, local as well as international, so be sure to check the line up get tickets in advance.</p>
